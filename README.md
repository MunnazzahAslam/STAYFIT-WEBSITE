# STAYFIT WEBSITE
StayFit is a website that tracks diet and exercise to determine optimal caloric intake and nutrients for the users' goals and uses gamification elements to motivate users.
How does StayFit work?
Using StayFit is very simple. Here's how our basic process works: 

1. Based on your fitness profile, we'll recommend a daily Net Calorie target for you to achieve your weight loss (or gain) goals. 

2. As you eat throughout the day and perform different exercises, you need to log your meals and exercise in StayFit food and exercise options. StayFit will calculate the number of calories you've consumed from food and burned from exercise and let you know how many calories you have left to eat for the day. If you stick within your calorie limits, you should achieve the weight loss (or gain) you're looking for. 

3. The best part of our system is the ease of use for our users. StayFit remembers the foods and exercises you like most and makes it easy for you to add those items to your diary. 

4. Periodically (we recommend once a week), you should weigh yourself and check-in your new weight with the site or the app using our Check-In feature (or "Progress" page in the app). Checking in your weight allows us to track your progress over time and also adjust your calorie goals to reflect your new weight. You can also check your BMI to know if you are underweight, overweight or fine.

That's it! Just a few minutes a day can show you so much about what you're eating and how that impacts your health.
